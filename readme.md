cd hr-dashboard

3. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file.
pip install -r requirements.txt


5. Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project and add your Google Gemini API key.
# .env
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"


The application will automatically load this key. Alternatively, you can enter the key directly in the UI.
